## Description
   AS A developer
   I WANT a README generator
   SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
   This project is base in a node.js application that accepts user input
   WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository. The app 
   starts with a welcome message. Then WHEN I enter my project title
   THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
   WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
   THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
   WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
   THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
   WHEN I enter my GitHub username
   THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
   WHEN I enter my email address
   THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
   WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
   THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
